Short notes for contributors and maintainers.

## Preferred package manager

This repository uses npm as the preferred package manager. Please use the following commands when installing dependencies or running the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you prefer pnpm or yarn, coordinate with the maintainers before adding or committing another lockfile (for example `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `yarn.lock`).
